DESCRIPTIONThe interactive application is built using Shiny which is an open-source web application framework for R. Shiny apps have 2 components – a user interface script (ui.R) that controls that layout and appearance of the app and a server script (server.R) which contains the instructions the computer needs to build the app. Our server script carries out 3 tasks:1. Train logistic regression model on the final dataset2. Validate the model on the test data and display the results3. Use information via user interface to predict default probability (includes text analysis)4. Display supporting visualizationsThe user interface consists of a side panel where user data is entered and the main panel is divided into 2 self-explanatory tabs – Model Info (evaluation of model) and Default Risk (prediction based on user data). The Default risk tab will display relative strength of some predictors as well as text analysis results.INSTALLATIONR packages are installed using install.packages(). We require the installation of the following packages. Model is built using RStudio Version 1.0.143 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3). Windows users might face issues so preferably run the app on a Mac.1. shiny - Interactive app2. broom - tidy is used to get the model summary in a clean format3. googleVis - Create gauge displays for evaluation metrics4. plotly - Used to create visualizations5. pROC – Used to calculate AUC metric and draw the ROC curveEXECUTION

DOWNLOAD LOAN DATA -> data_potential_predictors_train_SMOTE.csv and data_potential_predictors_test.csv

NOTE: These are the final datasets created after data cleaning and feature selection. Original datasets are all files containing ‘LoanStats’ in the same DOWNLOAD LOAN DATA folder and have been downloaded from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

Download the datasets and store in the working directory (where server.R and ui.R files are present). Also save ‘Text Analysis Results.csv’ in the working directory. Cross check that all files are correctly referenced.

To run the app, simply open it in Rstudio and click Run App on either of the two files. If you face an error concerning ‘plotlyoutput’, run the library(plotly) command before trying again. If all packages are installed correctly, no other error should pop up. On initial startup, enter data and hit Submit to start the model building process. This will take some time. Once loaded, user data can be altered and visualizations will change reactively and immediately. However, to calculate new probability of default, it is required to hit the submit button again.
